The material is used to outline one model. There is just one shader, I will detail those parments:

Outline Color : Outline's color

Outline Factor : The lerp parment of vertice's direction and vertice's normal direction.

Outline Width : Outline's width.

Body Alpha : The body's alpha value, used to controll body's transparancy.
